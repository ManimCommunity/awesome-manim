[awesome-manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/awesome-manim) is a GitHub repo that contains YouTube channels that create content using [Manim](https://manim.community/).

On this website, we automatically fetch the videos from the channels listed in that repo, so that they can all be viewed in one place. We hope that this will increase the visibility of new channels and encourage more people to produce their videos using Manim.

## About Manim

[Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) is an community maintained Python library for creating mathematical animations. It was created in 2015 by Grant Sanderson, a.k.a. 3blue1brown, as a personal project to produce his own videos. As his channel gained popularity, many grew to like the style of his animations and wanted to use Manim for their own projects. However, as Manim was only intended for personal use, it was very difficult for other users to install and use it.

Manim has since been adopted by a group of developers, who forked it mid-2020 into what is now known as the [community edition](https://manim.community). Grant on the other hand still continues to produce videos using [his original branch](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/), having added OpenGL support. There are ongoing efforts in the Manim Community to reconcile these changes into the community edition. Check out [this page](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/versions.html) for more information on the different versions of Manim currently under development.
