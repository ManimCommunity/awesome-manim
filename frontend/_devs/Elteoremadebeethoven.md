I work **by project**, not by hours. This is because this is not my full-time job, so if the job is too long I can reject it. Depending on the project, I will estimate an initial price, **<u>this price is fully negotiable</u>**, since depending on the country and the urgency the price may vary.

### Price

The price of each project is determined by the following characteristics:

- <u>Duration of the video</u>: The duration can be due to many factors, so this is the one that has the least impact on the project.

- <u>Your geographical location</u>. I am aware that purchasing power varies from country to country, so depending on your country the price may vary.

- <u>Complexity of each animation</u>: The price increases if advanced knowledge of Mathematics is needed to make an animation, since animating a simple linear transformation is not the same as animating the change of a vector field. Also, if an animation requires more advanced programming processes, the price will also increase.

- <u>Urgency of the project</u>: If a delivery date is not indicated, I will adjust the date depending on my free time, but if you need it urgently then the price will increase.

- <u>The number of steps</u>: An animation may be simple, but it could has many steps, so this field is also very variable.

- <u>Estimated price</u>: If you have doubts about how much I would charge you to make an animation, you can see some examples [here](https://zavden.github.io/freelance-job/docs/html/jobs/examples.html).

### Payment method

If the agreed price is **less than 150 USD** (for the US and Europe, 100 USD for the rest of the world) then half will be paid in advance, if it costs more than that amount, it will only be paid the 3rd part, and half the work the second third part will be paid. All payments are made by PayPal or bank transfer.

### What you need to do

You have to send me the **details of the projects**, anything that helps clarify your ideas, some examples are:

- Sketches with indications of each animation.
- Images or videos similar to what you want.
- Timelines.

### Other terms

- I only do the visual part and I can add some music (I don't narrate). All the non-Manim software I need to use is opensource or freeware (inkscape, Krita, Gimp, Blender, etc).
- The code of animations are yours and yours alone, I will deliver it to you in full when the last payment is made. If you **are not** interested in having the source code, the price decreases.

### Contact

You can contact me using the links above (Discord is the best option for me).

When you contact me, please make sure that your message contains all the above points in order to give you the most fair price estimate:
1. Geographical location.
2. Urgency of the project.
3. In case you have a budget limit please let me know.
4. Let me know if you want me to not share your code.
